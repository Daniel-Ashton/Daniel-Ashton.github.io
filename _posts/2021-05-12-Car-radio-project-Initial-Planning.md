As a student, I have to try to find more cost-effective ways of living, whether it be store discounts or buying things second hand, lowering overall costs means I can more effectively manage my budget. This is the main reason I started this project, the desire for an aftermarket radio that holds all of the luxuries that I would look for in a more modern car whilst not breaking the bank is a far more difficult task than it seems. Being an electronics engineer, I took it upon myself to attempt to build my own radio that will fit my car and contain all of the luxuries that I would like while also staying at a lower cost to an ordinary aftermarket radio of the same specification.
