As a student, I have to try to find more cost-effective ways of living, whether it be store discounts or buying things second hand, lowering overall costs means I can more effectively manage my budget. This is the main reason I started this project, the desire for an aftermarket radio that holds all of the luxuries that I would look for in a more modern car whilst not breaking the bank is a far more difficult task than it seems. Being an electronics engineer, I took it upon myself to attempt to build my own radio that will fit my car and contain all of the luxuries that I would like while also staying at a lower cost to an ordinary aftermarket radio of the same specification.

## Planning the radio functions
Obviously, the radio needs to operate for its intended purpose, so first and foremost, the radio needs to contain a radio module. Nowadays, modern radio systems broadcast using frequency modulated (FM) waves because of the reduced interference. This is what I plan on using as the basic audio for my car,  but this will be analysed later. 
Next, another form of radio signal Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB), this is a more modern form of radio signal broadcasting as it uses a digital signal rather than the more traditional analogue signal used by FM and amplitude modulation (AM). Although not as widely used as FM yet, DAB holds an advantage as a system that has the possibility to broadcast a wider range of signals and at a quality far higher, as digital frequencies prove to be far less susceptible to interference and noise than the traditional analogue methods. Radio systems in more modern cars now use both DAB and FM, so it seems fitting that it should be included in my radio system as well.
Although this project has only discussed radio options for audio so far, it seems only fitting that in a world encompassed by mobile devices this allow for such connectivity. Like most modern aftermarket systems, this system will allow for mobile connectivity to allow audio to be played through the car. This can be done by a number of methods, including:
* USB,
* AUX,
* Bluetooth,
* Internet.
Which comes to the next point, comfort products. Even though this may already appear to be a comfort product, in-car entertainment systems are now an integral part of the driving experience, with cars like Tesla’s having most in-car functions controlled by an integrated ‘[infotainment system](https://www.tesla.com/support/infotainment)’. While my system may not be as fancy, I do like the technology it uses and it’s design and hope to use some ideas from it.
Firstly, I think an internet connection is a comfort addition which will prove useful, as it allows for better connectivity with mobile devices and can improve entertainment features within the car. Not only this, but it will prove vital for another component I wish to add, Global Positioning System (GPS). As a young driver, I tend to find that exploring new places comes as a habit, but can be risky when I lose track of where I am and often find myself using my phone as a GPS. But, if integrated into the radio system, it would mean that I wouldn’t have to pull over to sort it out, and instead could rely on a passenger to set it up instead.
All of these features rely on one key component, a display.
